This is an outline of how the variable-differential pid controller should work

initialization
  Parameters:
    -number of differentiation levels
    -(optional):PID(F) values for each differentiation level
    -other default PID controller things

controller loop
  -is the 0th derivative setpoint met?, yes = stop, no = continue
  -is the 1st derivative setpoint met?, yes = continue moving at speed, no = continue
  -is the 2nd derivative setpoint met?, yes = continue accelerating at this rate, no = continue
  -... STOP
